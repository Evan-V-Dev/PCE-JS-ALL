# PCE-JS-ALL
An emulator for NodeJS

PCE-JS-ALL is a project that uses PCE.js

PCE-JS-ALL is a repo that has all of the OS emulators in PCE.js, it has a simple launcher too! (Only for linux, or anything that runs bash)

SOON:

I will import a feature into the "Easy Launcher" that you can change the port of the http server.

WITHOUT BASH:

1. Download NodeJS.
2. Go to the PCE directory.
3. Go to the OS Directory you want. ( MAC = Mac Plus IBM = MS-DOS AST = ATARI ST )
